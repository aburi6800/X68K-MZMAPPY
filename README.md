## Overview

An attempt to create a game in as standard an environment as possible using X-BASIC on the SHARP X68000.
Since the execution speed on the interpreter is very slow, the BASIC program is converted to C source and an executable file is created using a C compiler.

<br>

## Compile from BASIC Source

- if using X68000 XC, do the following:

```
A:>cc sprtest.bas
```
